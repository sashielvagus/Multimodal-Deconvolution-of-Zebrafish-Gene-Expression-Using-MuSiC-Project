# Zebrafish Gene Expression Deconvolution Using MuSiC

This repository contains R scripts and resources for deconvolving bulk RNA-seq gene expression data in **zebrafish**, using **MuSiC (Multi-subject Single-cell deconvolution)**. The goal is to investigate how **environmental exposures** influence gene expression at the **cell-type level**, using single-cell RNA-seq references from both **pancreas-specific** and **whole-zebrafish** sources.

## ðŸ§  Project Objective

To estimate **cell type proportions** in bulk RNA-seq samples of zebrafish and assess how they shift in response to environmental exposures. This is achieved through multimodal analysis by integrating:

- **Bulk RNA-seq gene counts** (exposed vs control)
- **Single-cell RNA-seq reference data** (annotated by cell type)

## ðŸ“Š Script Details

### `deconvolution_bulk_zebrafish_to_zebrafish_pancreas.R`

- Uses pancreas-specific cell types (e.g., alpha, beta_1, duct)
- Converts Seurat object (`Control_annotated.rds`) into `SingleCellExperiment`
- Performs MuSiC deconvolution and outputs:
  - Jitter plot comparing MuSiC vs NNLS estimates
  - Heatmap of estimated proportions
  - Stacked bar plot of cell type distributions

### `deconvolution_bulk_zebrafish_to_whole_zebrafish.R`

- Uses Daniocell 2023 dataset as scRNA-seq reference (`Daniocell2023_SeuratV4.rds`)
- Converts both bulk and single-cell data into `ExpressionSet`
- Performs MuSiC deconvolution using the entire cellular atlas
- Outputs the same set of visualizations and CSV matrices
